    <section>
        <p>Hello, I'm a Junior Electrical Engineering undergraduate at Purdue University! I'm interested in all sorts of things like
            astrophotography, amateur radio, tinkering with circuits and Arduinos and plenty more. This webpage is my own documentation
            of anything I do that I personally deem to be "cool enough" to put on the internet. I hope anyone viewing this will find
            interest in my projects, and If you have any questions, comments or want to get in touch with me for any reason, please email
            me at slamovichaaron@gmail.com.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Overdrive Electric Guitar Pedal</h3>
        <p>I designed an overdrive pedal to distort audio from an electric guitar input. This uses a simple operational amplifier
        to amplify the signal beyond the ability of the voltage supply to keep up with the gain. This results in the peaks of the
        signal being "cut off" because they go beyond the opamp's ability to recreate the signal at its greatest magnitudes.
        For signal processing or data logging this is horrible, but for Jimi Hendrix it's rock on! I also included a potentiometer between
            the output and negative input of the opamp to provide variability on the opamp's gain so the amount of distortion could be varied.

        <h3>"Listening" to the sun and trying to talk to astronauts</h3>
        <p>I recently got my HAM radio technician license (callsign KE9AVI if anyone wants to talk over the airwaves
        old-fashioned style) and I've been using what I've learned to have fun with radio in general including *attempting* to talk
        to astronauts and "listening" to the sun. The image below is a yagi-uda antenna I built out of PVC tube and tape measure, a
        common DIY design on the internet. I combined it with my SDR radio and SDR++ software to try listening to the sun.
        I managed to get modest results with noise strength increasing by a few decibles when I pointed my antenna towards the sun.
        This experiment is not what I would call scientifically rigorous but it was lots of fun.</p>

        <h3>Automated NERF Blaster Powered by Machine Learning (add a crazy overly dramatic font to ML)</h3>
        <p>This project was definitely a blast! (Ha.) I wanted to make something my middle-school self would be proud of,
        so I made a NERF gun mod to automatically shoot at my brother so I wouldn't have to press the trigger (it works on any
        person though). I used the NERF Modulus as the base for my mod because it was a convenient size and already had fly wheels
        in it so it was semi-automatic. My challenge was modifying it to be fully automatic. A webcam at the front of the blaster
        sends a video stream to an onboard raspberry pi running a TFLite object detection model. I used open cv to track the bounding
        boxes of the people detected in the video stream and wrote a python script using a gpio library to actuate a servo when the
        bounding box of a person was near the center of the frame. I had to remove some plastic scaffolding inside the gun to be able to
        fit the servo inside but once I did it was quite snug. The servo controlled a plunger that would press a dart between the fly wheels
        to send it flying.</p>

        <h3>Heartbeat Detector</h3>
        <p>I made this project with my lab partner as a final project in our electrical engineering fundamentals lab. The conceptual
        founation behind the monitor is that each heartbeat will cause body tissue to flush with blood. The amount of infrared light
        passing through the finger is measured with the idea that an increase in blood will absorb more light allowing us to detect
        each heartbeat by an increase in IR absorbance. An infrared LED is used as a light source and an infrared photo-resistor
        is used as the infrared sensor. I used the photo-resistor as part of a voltage divider so that the voltage would change as the
        resistance of the photo-resistor changed with the amount of infrared absorbance. This provided a small spike in voltage with each
        heartbeat, but the signal was obscured by background noise such as RF signals and static discharge. To "clean" the input signal
        I added a low-pass filter with a center frequency of 100 HZ (the assumed upper limit of my resting heart rate) and a high-pass
        filter with a center frequency of 40 HZ (the assumed lower limit of my resting heart rate). Finally, I added hysteresis as the
        last part of my signal processing. This compared the current signal to a moving average of the signal's history. I used a comparator
            made with an opamp to compare the current signal to its hysteresis. If there was a significant difference the comparator
            would act as the simplest possible analog to digital converter and provide a pulse of current to light an indicator LED.</p>

        <p>The image above displays the digital output of the comparator in orange and the output of the filtered signal in blue.</p>
        <h3>Genetic Data Base</h3>
        <p>I used Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL to design the front end and backend of a genetic database storing over 20,000 genes
        including information on targeted drugs and common gene mutations. Before building this project I had only made
        static webpages before with HTML and CSS, so I had to learn a lot on the fly. One of the challenges I faced was finding a way
        to load so much data onto the website. I couldn't type all the information in by hand so I wrote python scripts to
        take CSV files and automatically load them into my database, so I could run the process before I went to bed and wake up
        to the finished result. Code can be found here: https://github.com/aaronSlamovich/NucleoDepot</p>
