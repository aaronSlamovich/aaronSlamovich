    <section>
        <p>Hello, I'm a Junior Electrical Engineering undergraduate at Purdue University! I'm interested in all sorts of things like
            astrophotography, amateur radio, tinkering with circuits and Arduinos and plenty more. This webpage is my own documentation
            of anything I do that I personally deem to be "cool enough" to put on the internet. I hope anyone viewing this will find
            interest in my projects, and If you have any questions, comments or want to get in touch with me for any reason, please email
            me at slamovichaaron@gmail.com!</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Overdrive Electric Guitar Pedal</h3>
        <p>I designed an overdrive pedal to distort audio from an electric guitar input. This uses a simple operational amplifier
        to amplify the signal beyond the ability of the voltage supply to keep up with the gain. This results in the peaks of the
        signal being "cut off" because they go beyond the opamp's ability to recreate the signal at its greatest magnitudes.
        For signal processing or data logging this is horrible, but for Jimi Hendrix it's rock on! I also included a potentiometer between
            the output and negative input of the opamp to provide variability on the opamp's gain so the amount of distortion could be varied.

        <h3>"Listening" to the sun and trying to talk to astronauts</h3>
        <p>I recently got my HAM radio technician license (callsign KE9AVI if anyone wants to talk over the airwaves
        old-fashioned style) and I've been using what I've learned to have fun with radio in general including *attempting* to talk
        to astronauts and "listening" to the sun. The image below is a yagi-uda antenna I built out of PVC tube and tape measure, a
        common DIY design on the internet. I combined it with my SDR radio and SDR++ software to try listening to the sun.
        I managed to get modest results with noise strength increasing by a few decibles when I pointed my antenna towards the sun.
        This experiment is not what I would call scientifically rigorous but it was lots of fun.</p>

        <h3>Automated NERF Blaster Powered by Machine Learning (add a crazy overly dramatic font to ML)</h3>
        <p>This project was definitely a blast! (Ha.) I wanted to make something my middle-school self would be proud of,
        so I made a NERF gun mod to automatically shoot at my brother so I wouldn't have to press the trigger (it works on any
        person though). I used the NERF Modulus as the base for my mod because it was a convenient size and already had fly wheels
        in it so it was semi-automatic. My challenge was modifying it to be fully automatic. A webcam at the front of the blaster
        sends a video stream to an onboard raspberry pi running a TFLite object detection model. I used open cv to track the bounding
        boxes of the people detected in the video stream and wrote a python script using a gpio library to actuate a servo when the
        bounding box of a person was near the center of the frame. I had to remove some plastic scaffolding inside the gun to be able to
        fit the servo inside but once I did it was quite snug. The servo controlled a plunger that would press a dart between the fly wheels
        to send it flying.</p>
